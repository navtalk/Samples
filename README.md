# NavTalk Samples

> Official sample code and Software Development Kit (SDK) for the **NavTalk Real-time Virtual Digital Human Platform**.

NavTalk provides everything you need to build immersive, real-time digital human experiences. These samples demonstrate how to
integrate NavTalk across web, mobile, and backend applications, making it ideal for intelligent customer service and virtual
assistant scenarios.



## ‚ú® Core Features

NavTalk SDK enables your digital human applications with:

| Capability | Description |
| --- | --- |
| üß† Intelligent Conversation & Decision Making | Large language models deliver deep language understanding and multi-turn reasoning. |
| üåç Multi-language Real-time Interaction | Supports real-time speech recognition and synthesis for 50+ languages with over 95% accuracy. |
| üëÑ Natural Expression & Lip Sync | Deep learning-powered lip synchronization makes on-screen avatars feel natural and expressive. |
| üòä Emotional Perception & Adaptation | Emotion recognition detects user sentiment and adjusts responses for human-like interactions. |
| üé® Highly Customizable | Tune persona, tone, appearance, and other settings to match any scenario. |
| ‚ö° Low-latency Real-time Communication | WebSocket/WebRTC architecture keeps end-to-end latency below 2000 ms. |

### Future Roadmap

NavTalk SDK will also support more features such as **camera capture**, **online connectivity**, and more to further enhance digital human expressiveness and interactive experience.

## Contributing

We welcome feedback and community contributions that improve these samples. To propose a change:

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Make your updates, ensuring code style and lint rules for the specific platform are followed.
3. Test your changes locally (web clients with `npm run build`, mobile projects with the respective IDE or CLI tools, and the Java backend using `mvn test`).
4. Submit a pull request summarizing the motivation and verification steps.

If you find a bug or have an enhancement idea but cannot submit code, please [open an issue](https://github.com/navtalk/Samples/issues) with as much detail as possible (logs, steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, environment info, etc.).


## Troubleshooting Checklist

Before opening an issue, verify the following common fixes:

- **Environment Versions** ‚Äì Ensure the Node.js, Java, Android Studio, Xcode, and Flutter SDK versions match the prerequisites listed above.
- **Dependency Installs** ‚Äì Delete lockfiles and `node_modules`/`Pods` directories if package installs fail, then reinstall (`npm install`, `pod install`, etc.).
- **WebRTC Permissions** ‚Äì When testing in browsers or on mobile, allow microphone/camera access or provide mock input sources to avoid connection failures.
- **Backend Connectivity** ‚Äì Confirm the WebServer sample is reachable and configured with valid NavTalk credentials before running web or mobile clients.
- **Gradle/CocoaPods Caches** ‚Äì Clear caches (`./gradlew clean`, `pod cache clean --all`) if builds behave inconsistently after updates.
